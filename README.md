# python-ransomware


This program is no joke and you can really hurt somebody with this , that said this is for EDUCATIONAL purposes only! I am not responsible if you cause damage to somebodys property!

That said you are free to download the program and try to reverse it. (Try to fix the encryption without paying the ransom).
Source code is free as long as you mention me.
